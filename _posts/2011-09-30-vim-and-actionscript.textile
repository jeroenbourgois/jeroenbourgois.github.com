Sometimes for small Flash projects, I don't want to use the slow hog that is Flash Builder (aka Flex Builder), so I do my scripting, as always, in Vim. But by default there is no syntax file for actionscript. I found an excellent sample script by "Abdul Qabiz":http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/2007/10/12/vim-actionscript-and-mxml-syntax-files/, and mirrored it on "github":https://github.com/jeroenbourgois/vim-actionscript for easy of use and consistency. (I load all my bundles through "Vundle":https://github.com/gmarik/vundle and all bundles come from github).

Have fun!

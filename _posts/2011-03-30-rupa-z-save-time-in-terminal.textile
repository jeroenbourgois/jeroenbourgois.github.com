title: Rupa "Z" save time in terminal
---

h2. {{Â page.title }}

Not a big post this time, but a timesaver for the terminal addicts out there. Almost every time (and I do mean almost *_each and every_* time) I use the cool "z":https://github.com/rupa/z command in terminal followed by a folder name, I am again amazed and pleased with the result. Simply put, it is a script that allows you to jump to your recent folders (and "recent" actually can be long ago) by using part of a path or folder name. It also keeps a ranking for each folder, so if you were working in
@/root/some/long/path/to/your/projects/SomeCrazyProjects@
then you can just hit:
@z crazy@
And you'll get there. For more info, just go to "https://github.com/rupa/z":https://github.com/rupa/z and try it out!

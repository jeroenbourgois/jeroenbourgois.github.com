    <h1>The Fabfile</h1>
<p>Since a couple of projects I have been using a neat little tool to manage my deployments: <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.3/index.html">Fabric</a><br />
As the site states, Fabric is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fabric is a Python (2.5 or higher) library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of <span class="caps">SSH</span> for application deployment or systems administration tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really does it&#8217;s job well, and with minimal setup effort. So now all I do is @fab deploy and my remote server pulls the latest version from my bitbucket git repo, restarts the upstart task and voila: new version online!</p>
<p>I think I should investigate Fabric a bit more, as I feel it has more power than just a mere deploy. Great stuff!</p>

    <h1>Am I a crafstman?</h1>
<p>I am on the verge of building our own house. Or to be precise: to let other qualified people build my house. I am not that much of a &#8216;handy-man&#8217; myself, so I put my trust in others to do the job &#8211; thoroughly &#8211; for me. But we (as in &#8216;us&#8217;, the so called <i>unhandy</i>) know that feeling every once in a while, when the tap is dripping or the closet just doesn&#8217;t close like it should. Or those times that stupid dishwasher just stopped working!</p>
<p>There will be plenty of people discouraging me to fix it myself since I&#8217;m not <i>handy</i>. All those years I have been hearing the same, not just for me, but for a lot of my fellow programmers, webdevelopers, nerds &amp; geeks. We are <strong>not handy</strong>. And strangely, I just accepted and <i>even believed</i> that!</p>
<p>OK, truth to be told, I am really not good at masonry, carpentry or another traditional craft. But does that mean I am not a craftsman? Day in day out I make software <strong>by hand</strong>. I manually type in every character to created structures that the computer can understand.  I am a web developer, and I make my sites by hand. I have no tool with a button that says &#8216;create site&#8217;.</p>
<p>Than is it not a true craft? Websites qualify to be called software, if you think otherwise, try building one with a backend system + authentication + database communication + automated e-mail + a picture gallery and a big (<strong><span class="caps">BIG</span></strong>) client logo. That will just about give you a basic website. Ok, fair enough, I use tools. I use other software that helps me get the job done quicker. But so does a carpenter. He doesn&#8217;t cut a plank in two by hand now does he?</p>
<p>I am a craftsman, and a damned good one. So are all of us geeks and programmers. We create complex things, by hand and a lot of times by heart. We even take it one step further sometimes, working without a manual and with technologies that change faster than McDonald&#8217;s brings out a new burger. So we should start being proud of our crafstmanship! But we aren&#8217;t proud, we just build it and move on to the next one. Cause that&#8217;s how we roll.</p>

    <h1>Pharao, create .phar files like a King</h1>
<p>We have a small internal framework, which uses the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/?src=hpbt">Zend</a> framework amongst other stuff. We chose Zend because it is well documented and widespread, and also feature rich. The basic framework (here I mean <cite>our</cite> framework) only includes some components of the Zend framework, but when we took a look at the amount of single files, we saw they were plenty! <br />
This has it&#8217;s impact on <strong>svn checkouts and commits</strong> &#8211; time wise &#8211; rather than on disk usage.</p>
<p>Besides Zend there was also <a href="http://www.limonade-php.net/">Limonade <span class="caps">PHP</span></a>, which was the basis of our ported version. Both are needed on load, but it would be easier if they could be combined into a single package. That&#8217;s when <code>phar</code> files come into place.</p>
<p>You can see them as a zip/tar/gzip archive that contains all of the library files. Because it was kind of a hassle to generate one, I had to find some bits and pieces on the net, so I thought I&#8217;d collect them into an executable.</p>
<p>You just do:<br />
<code>pharao -s SOURCE_DIR -p PHARNAME.phar</code></p>
<p>And the phar should be generated.</p>

<p>Big credits to <b>Cal Evans and John Douglass</b> for all the code!</p>

<p>All is on <a href="https://github.com/jeroenbourgois/pharao">GitHub</a> and ready to be improved!</p>

    <h1><span class="caps">SSD</span> Rocks!</h1>
<p>So to be honest, I am <em>far</em> from a tech savvy computer hardware wiz, but I know one thing: <span class="caps">SSD</span> hard disks rock! To be more clear&#8230;</p>
<p>As a small &#8216;new years gift&#8217; :) the IT department at work gave me a brand new <span class="caps">SSD</span> hard disk, as a test drive before upgrading all systems. Only a few months ago I already had performance improvement when I received a 4 GB <span class="caps">RAM</span> update, breing the total to 8GB. This was particularly useful when running VirtualBox images, as I saw the swap file increasing then. And as we know, swaps are costly.</p>
<p>But frankly, in day to day use, besides the VM&#8217;s, I find the <span class="caps">SSD</span> update much more rewarding. Maybe it&#8217;s a combination of both &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t say since I don&#8217;t have objective benchmarks &#8211; but that <span class="caps">SSD</span> really helped a lot. It even shows in the small things, such as opening Microsoft Word <em>***shiver***</em>. I don&#8217;t do it often, as I don&#8217;t <em>need</em> it to work, but some info just comes as .doc sometimes, as it does as xls.</p>
<p>Before I always sighed &#8216;<cite>pffff another 10-20 seconds wasted</cite>&#8217; What are 10 seconds you say? Well actually, a lot! For just a text document of 100 lines? Hell, I open a 10 000 lines text file in Vim in less than 5 seconds. So having those docs and xls&#8217;s opening in &lt;5 secs is a blessing.</p>
<p>Than we have other more obvious performance boosts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>boot times reduced</li>
	<li>Photoshop is on fire now!</li>
	<li>What, Flash can be fast too ? ( besides the fact those stupid fonts still take too much time )</li>
	<li>Getting file info inside Finder is a breeze</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, I have the feeling I am even missing out on the details, those kind of details you only notice if you would go back to the old &#8216;slow&#8217; hdd.</p>
<p>As far as space is concerned, it is still rather limited when you don&#8217;t want to spend â‚¬ 300+, but for me 180GB is sufficient. And if I would run out of space, I can still place my personal music on an external <span class="caps">HDD</span>, it does not need to be fast, and in essence, it&#8217;s not <em>needed</em> for work.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, no benchmarks, but just a gut feeling: <span class="caps">SSD</span> rocks!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a happy camper :)</p>

    <h2>Vim and Actionscript</h2>
<p>Sometimes for small Flash projects, I don&#8217;t want to use the slow hog that is Flash Builder (aka Flex Builder), so I do my scripting, as always, in Vim. But by default there is no syntax file for actionscript. I found an excellent sample script by <a href="http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/2007/10/12/vim-actionscript-and-mxml-syntax-files/">Abdul Qabiz</a>, and mirrored it on <a href="https://github.com/jeroenbourgois/vim-actionscript">github</a> for easy of use and consistency. (I load all my bundles through <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a> and all bundles come from github).</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

    <h1>Behat and <span class="caps">PHP</span> 5.3.5</h1>
<p>Yesterday, I was trying to install <a href="http://behat.org/">behat</a>, a nice <span class="caps">BDD</span> framework for <span class="caps">PHP</span>. But although following the instructions on their site, I got a &#8220;behat command not found&#8221; error when trying to run it. So the actual executable could not be found. My system was looking in /usr/local/lib, but not finding a symlink to my homebrew folder for behat specifically. So I just created it myself, and it worked perfectlly :). Here is the symlink:</p>
<p><code>ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/php/5.3.5/bin/behat /usr/local/bin/behat</code></p>
<p>Hope I can help someone else who has the same problem!</p>

    <h2>Rupa &#8220;Z&#8221; save time in terminal</h2>
<p>Not a big post this time, but a timesaver for the terminal addicts out there. Almost every time (and I do mean almost <strong><em>each and every</em></strong> time) I use the cool <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">z</a> command in terminal followed by a folder name, I am again amazed and pleased with the result. Simply put, it is a script that allows you to jump to your recent folders (and &#8220;recent&#8221; actually can be long ago) by using part of a path or folder name. It also keeps a ranking for each folder, so if you were working in<br />
<code>/root/some/long/path/to/your/projects/SomeCrazyProjects</code><br />
then you can just hit:<br />
<code>z crazy</code><br />
And you&#8217;ll get there. For more info, just go to <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">https://github.com/rupa/z</a> and try it out!</p>

    <h2>Command-t, MacVim and <span class="caps">RVM</span></h2>
<p>Yesterday, I really wanted to try out the Vim <a href="https://wincent.com/products/command-t">command-t</a> plugin to open files fast and smart. But you <strong>need</strong> a vim compiled with ruby support, which the default <span class="caps">OSX</span> vim lacks. A good option is to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim">MacVim</a>, but I ran into a problem, something like:<br />
<br />
<code>command-t.vim could not load the C extension</code><br />
<br />
After some digging, I found that <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com"><span class="caps">RVM</span></a> was causing the problems. As I found on the CommandT forums, CommandT should be build <span class="label warning"><strong>against exactly the same ruby version</strong></span> as MacVim is build against (which is 1.8.7 for MacVim Version 7.3). So here is what I did:<br />

  <h2>Making the switch</h2>
<p>After migrating to Posterous a while, I decided to give the Github Pages a try. We will see how this adventure goes.</p>

  <h2>Vim and Actionscript</h2>
<p>Sometimes for small Flash projects, I don&#8217;t want to use the slow hog that is Flash Builder (aka Flex Builder), so I do my scripting, as always, in Vim. But by default there is no syntax file for actionscript. I found an excellent sample script by <a href="http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/2007/10/12/vim-actionscript-and-mxml-syntax-files/">Abdul Qabiz</a>, and mirrored it on <a href="https://github.com/jeroenbourgois/vim-actionscript">github</a> for easy of use and consistency. (I load all my bundles through <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a> and all bundles come from github).</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

  <h1>Behat and <span class="caps">PHP</span> 5.3.5</h1>
<p>Yesterday, I was trying to install <a href="http://behat.org/">behat</a>, a nice <span class="caps">BDD</span> framework for <span class="caps">PHP</span>. But although following the instructions on their site, I got a &#8220;behat command not found&#8221; error when trying to run it. So the actual executable could not be found. My system was looking in /usr/local/lib, but not finding a symlink to my homebrew folder for behat specifically. So I just created it myself, and it worked perfectlly :). Here is the symlink:</p>
<p><code>ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/php/5.3.5/bin/behat /usr/local/bin/behat</code></p>
<p>Hope I can help someone else who has the same problem!</p>

  <h2>MongoDB group by with Mongoose</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> lately to connect to a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>&quot; from a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> app, and along the way I needed an equivalent of the mysql &#8216;<strong>group by</strong>&#8217; syntax. While the MongoDB documentation contained info about how to do a group by, I couldn&#8217;t get it to work with Mongoose. After a bit of trial and error I came up with this:</p>

  <h2>Rupa &#8220;Z&#8221; save time in terminal</h2>
<p>Not a big post this time, but a timesaver for the terminal addicts out there. Almost every time (and I do mean almost <strong><em>each and every</em></strong> time) I use the cool <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">z</a> command in terminal followed by a folder name, I am again amazed and pleased with the result. Simply put, it is a script that allows you to jump to your recent folders (and &#8220;recent&#8221; actually can be long ago) by using part of a path or folder name. It also keeps a ranking for each folder, so if you were working in<br />
<code>/root/some/long/path/to/your/projects/SomeCrazyProjects</code><br />
then you can just hit:<br />
<code>z crazy</code><br />
And you&#8217;ll get there. For more info, just go to <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">https://github.com/rupa/z</a> and try it out!</p>

  <h2>Command-t, MacVim and <span class="caps">RVM</span></h2>
<p>Yesterday, I really wanted to try out the Vim <a href="https://wincent.com/products/command-t">command-t</a> plugin to open files fast and smart. But you <strong>need</strong> a vim compiled with ruby support, which the default <span class="caps">OSX</span> vim lacks. A good option is to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim">MacVim</a>, but I ran into a problem, something like:<br />
<br />
<code>command-t.vim could not load the C extension</code><br />
<br />
After some digging, I found that <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com"><span class="caps">RVM</span></a> was causing the problems. As I found on the CommandT forums, CommandT should be build <span class="label warning"><strong>against exactly the same ruby version</strong></span> as MacVim is build against (which is 1.8.7 for MacVim Version 7.3). So here is what I did:<br />

    <h2>Vim and Actionscript</h2>
<p>Sometimes for small Flash projects, I don&#8217;t want to use the slow hog that is Flash Builder (aka Flex Builder), so I do my scripting, as always, in Vim. But by default there is no syntax file for actionscript. I found an excellent sample script by <a href="http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/2007/10/12/vim-actionscript-and-mxml-syntax-files/">Abdul Qabiz</a>, and mirrored it on <a href="https://github.com/jeroenbourgois/vim-actionscript">github</a> for easy of use and consistency. (I load all my bundles through <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a> and all bundles come from github).</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

    <h1>Behat and <span class="caps">PHP</span> 5.3.5</h1>
<p>Yesterday, I was trying to install <a href="http://behat.org/">behat</a>, a nice <span class="caps">BDD</span> framework for <span class="caps">PHP</span>. But although following the instructions on their site, I got a &#8220;behat command not found&#8221; error when trying to run it. So the actual executable could not be found. My system was looking in /usr/local/lib, but not finding a symlink to my homebrew folder for behat specifically. So I just created it myself, and it worked perfectlly :). Here is the symlink:</p>
<p><code>ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/php/5.3.5/bin/behat /usr/local/bin/behat</code></p>
<p>Hope I can help someone else who has the same problem!</p>

    <h2>MongoDB group by with Mongoose</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> lately to connect to a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>&quot; from a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> app, and along the way I needed an equivalent of the mysql &#8216;<strong>group by</strong>&#8217; syntax. While the MongoDB documentation contained info about how to do a group by, I couldn&#8217;t get it to work with Mongoose. After a bit of trial and error I came up with this:</p>

    <h2>Rupa &#8220;Z&#8221; save time in terminal</h2>
<p>Not a big post this time, but a timesaver for the terminal addicts out there. Almost every time (and I do mean almost <strong><em>each and every</em></strong> time) I use the cool <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">z</a> command in terminal followed by a folder name, I am again amazed and pleased with the result. Simply put, it is a script that allows you to jump to your recent folders (and &#8220;recent&#8221; actually can be long ago) by using part of a path or folder name. It also keeps a ranking for each folder, so if you were working in<br />
<code>/root/some/long/path/to/your/projects/SomeCrazyProjects</code><br />
then you can just hit:<br />
<code>z crazy</code><br />
And you&#8217;ll get there. For more info, just go to <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">https://github.com/rupa/z</a> and try it out!</p>

    <h2>Command-t, MacVim and <span class="caps">RVM</span></h2>
<p>Yesterday, I really wanted to try out the Vim <a href="https://wincent.com/products/command-t">command-t</a> plugin to open files fast and smart. But you <strong>need</strong> a vim compiled with ruby support, which the default <span class="caps">OSX</span> vim lacks. A good option is to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim">MacVim</a>, but I ran into a problem, something like:<br />
<br />
<code>command-t.vim could not load the C extension</code><br />
<br />
After some digging, I found that <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com"><span class="caps">RVM</span></a> was causing the problems. As I found on the CommandT forums, CommandT should be build <span class="label warning"><strong>against exactly the same ruby version</strong></span> as MacVim is build against (which is 1.8.7 for MacVim Version 7.3). So here is what I did:<br />

    <h1>Nginx alongside Apache on <span class="caps">OSX</span></h1>
<p>The other day I wanted to experiment with the superfast nginx server on osx for static files, and to use the built-in apache webserver as power unit to process the dynamic content.</p>
<p>Although not very hard to setup, there are some thing you should bear in mind:</p>
<ul>
	<li>for each server (aka virtualhost) you will add to nginx, you will need to add a virtualhost to apache (at least if the server you were adding will have dynamic content)</li>
	<li>nginx has a good base documentation on it&#8217;s site, but I still think of it as an underdog server. That is, for every article you will find on the web for an nginx problem/issue, there will be 100 to find for apache.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyhow, let&#8217;s get on with it. Please not that I did not come up with all this myself, I found a lot of information scattered through different tutorials, which will be listed below. All credits to those authors!</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
	<li>install <a href="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">homebrew</a> , you&#8217;ll love it!</li>
	<li>install <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a></li>
</ul>
<p><code>brew install nginx</code></p>
<p>Installation done! On to the configuration</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Nginx</h3>
<p>First, let&#8217;s set up nginx so it uses the somewhat cleaner &#8220;sites-enabled/sites-available&#8221; structure. Some might already seen it on apache2 or somewhere else, and I find it cleaner than putting all your virtual hosts in one (or several) file. This way, for each site you add you create the config file in the sites-available folder, then symlink it in the sites-enabled folder and just have nginx to load all the files in the sites-enabled folder. That way, whenever you temporarly want do disable a virtual host, you can just remove the symlink, and not have to remove the actual config file (you might want to keep it for future reference).</p>
<ul>
	<li>Go to your nginx config folder (when installed with <em>homebrew</em>, that will typically be in <strong><code>/usr/local/etc/nginx/</code></strong></li>
	<li>There create two folders, <strong>sites-enable</strong> and <strong>sites-available</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/845454.js?file=nginx-create-folders"></script><ul>
	<li>open up <code>nginx.conf</code> in your favorite text editor and update it to your likings. My file is listed below, you can play with the settings, but it is important you have the &#8216;<strong>include sites-enabled/</strong>&#8217; line. That will make sure all your servers are loaded.</li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/845457.js?file=gistfile1.cpp"></script><ul>
	<li>go into the sites-available folder and create a server config file</li>
	<li>include the listing below (and change to your needs)</li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/845463.js?file=gistfile1.cpp"></script><ul>
	<li>now create a symlink to the file in the sites-enabled folder</li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/845467.js?file=gistfile1.eclass"></script><ul>
	<li>start nginx</li>
</ul>
<p><code>sudo nginx</code></p>
<ul>
	<li>or to restart:<br />
<code>sudo nginx -s reload</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Apache</h3>
<ul>
	<li>open httpd.conf, should be in <strong><code>/etc/apache2/httpd.conf</code></strong></li>
	<li>update the port apache listens on to <strong>127.0.0.1:8080</strong> (since nginx will be running on port 80, apache should be on another port), around line</li>
	<li>add your virtualhost (or include and external vhost file and add it there). Note that you could go for the same sites-enabled/sites-available setup here, like I did</li>
	<li>note that your virtualhost should have the <em><strong>same</strong></em> ServerName as the one you used in nginx, and it should listen on <strong>port 8080</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/845471.js?file=nginx-apache-vhost.xml"></script><ul>
	<li>restart apache</li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/846057.js?file=apache-restart"></script><h3>Hosts &amp; Go!</h3>
<p>Now just update your hosts file ( <strong>/etc/hosts</strong> ) to include your newly created server:<br />
<code>127.0.0.1 dropbox.local</code></p>
<p>And point your browser to http://dropbox.local. You should see the directory listing of all your folders, or if you planted a site there, it should run! If you do run into errors, first check out both the nginx and apache error logs in the Console, it might help you.</p>
